# AudioGlyph
Simple Audiobook GUI.
## Vision
Today there aren't any free and open source GUIs for managing audiobooks like there is Calibre for Ebooks.
Audioglyph aims to solve that problem.



‚ùóCurrently made with python but I'm considering moving to raylib or another, more well rounded GUI library.
