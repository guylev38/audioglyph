# AudioGlyph
Simple Audiobook GUI made with C and raylib/raygui.

## Vision
Today there aren't any free and open source GUIs for managing audiobooks (i.g. Calibre for Ebooks).
Audioglyph aims to solve that problem.

❗❗**If you want to contribute to this repository I strongly suggest that you fork it and build a better repo that can be better supported and maintained as I'm getting busy with other things and won't be able to maintain this project as something more serious than a side project.**
