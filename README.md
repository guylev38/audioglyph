# AudioGlyph
Simple Audiobook GUI made with C and raylib/raygui.

## Vision
Today there aren't any free and open source GUIs for managing audiobooks (i.g. Calibre for Ebooks).
Audioglyph aims to solve that problem.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Raylib: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
- Raygui: https://github.com/raysan5/raygui
- TinyFD: https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/
